  <h1>About Mia</h1>
        <hr/>
  <p>Hi! My name is Mia, I am a sophmore, I am 15 years old. I have <b>three</b> older siblings, one sister and two brothers. I also have two dogs, Molly and Utley. I live with both of my parents and 2 of my siblings. I like to read, spend time with my dogs, and watch tv in my free time. When I am not at school or home, I am at work. I work at Quinns cafe in Hockessin.</p>  
  <p>In the summer, I love going to the movies, mall, and the beach with my mom. My dream college to go to is <b>Fordham</b>. I would most likely major in law with a minor in either psycology or journalism. My dream car is, a 1964 Ford Pick up, but when I turn sixteen, I want an Equinox or something that size.</p>
  <p>My dream place to visit is Ireland, I have always liked the culture and history. It would be cool, to study abroad there, and get to know people and the differnt cities. After college, I want to move to a city like New York, or Los Angeles. I like the hustle and bustle of people everywhere and the different cultures. But, as I get older, I would want to move to a smaller town or back to Delaware to get married or have a family. To have the same life style that I have now. One of my favorite movies is called, 10 things I hate about you<p/> <blockquote>Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened </blockquote> - Dr. Suess
